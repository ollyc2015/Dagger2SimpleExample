# Dagger2SimpleExample

This is a very simple, commented example, to introduce the concepts of Dagger2 for beginners. 

All we attempt to do is use shared prefs to assign an integer and read it from the Logcat, and change the colour of a Textview.

Dagger2 is a fast dependency injector framework for Android and Java. It can simplify the code you write and provide an adaptive environment that's useful for testing and other configuration changes.

Dependence injection is a design pattern that is based on the concept of Inversion of Control which says that a class should get its dependencies from outside. 

In simple words, no class should instantiate another class but should get the instances from a configuration class instead of constructing them internally. 

So, this pattern allows developers to write code that has low coupling and which can therefore be easily tested and maintained.
